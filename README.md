# TechNative React Playground

This is the React practise exercise from the TechNative Digital Full Stack Bootcamp. It covers:
- Creating an app using Vite
- Deploying it on Netlify
- Creating suitable file structure
- Creating JSX components
- Routing
- CSS Modules

## Future Considerations

I had a couple of weeks off at this point of the bootcamp for a friend's wedding, so I don't feel as confident as I'd like with this topic.  I'm aiming to come back to this to practise the following (in no particular order):

- useState
- Passing Props
- useEffect
- React Forms
- useNavigate
- Using Redux to create a slices and a store
- Play more with CSS modules and their scoping
