## Future Considerations

I had a couple of weeks off at this point of the bootcamp for a friend's wedding, so I don't feel as confident as I'd like with this topic.  I'm aiming to come back to this to practise the following (in no particular order):


- Using Redux to create a slices and a store
- Play more with CSS modules and their scoping
